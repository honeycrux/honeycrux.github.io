# GitHub pages: the personal site

This is my experimental static site on GitHub Pages. This is not my homepage, but it may become one in the future. By the mean time, I use it for random purposes.

This page currently uses (notably) [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). These two quickly became my favourite web framework combo.
